### Unlocked by

[Navigation](<Navigation.md> "Navigation")

### Effect

Gives 8 stars

**Starfish Harvesting** is an ability that can only be used on a tile with a Starfish, removes the Starfish from the tile, and gives the player 8 [stars](</wiki/Stars> "Stars"). The ability is unlocked by the [Navigation](<Navigation.md> "Navigation") [technology](<Technology.md> "Technology"). 

Moving any naval unit onto a Starfish, even in neutral or enemy territory, will allow it to collect 8 stars by removing the Starfish the next turn. This consumes the unit's turn, much like if it were examining a [ruin](<Ruin.md> "Ruin").

  * Starfish were introduced in the [Path of the Ocean](<../game_mechanics/Map_Generation.md> "Map Generation") update to replace [Whales](<../technology/Whale_Hunting.md> "Whale Hunting") as the new aquatic resource harvested for stars.
  * In the subsequent Patch of the Ocean update, Starfish were changed to provide 8 stars instead of 10.
