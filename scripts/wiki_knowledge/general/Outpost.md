## History[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FOutpost%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D1&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

When Polaris was released, the Outpost produced two population. This made Polaris overpowered because the Outpost not only granted Polaris a cheap and plentiful source of population but also allowed the tribe to upgrade its capital on turn 0. In response, the Outpost was nerfed in the next update to produce only one population.
