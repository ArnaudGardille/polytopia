A Vengir Swordsman ready to examine a ruin.

A **ruin** provides a reward when examined by a [unit](</wiki/Unit> "Unit"). 

Examining a ruin requires a unit to start the turn on the ruin and consumes the unit's actions for that turn (like capturing a village). 

Ruins can spawn on all types of [terrain](<../game_mechanics/Terrain.md> "Terrain") except shallow water. However, ruins cannot spawn next to a capital [city](</wiki/City> "City") or another ruin. 

Tiles with ruins cannot be developed until the ruin is examined. For example, a player cannot [clear](</wiki/Clear_Forest> "Clear Forest") or build a [Lumber Hut](</wiki/Lumber_Hut> "Lumber Hut") on a forest tile with a ruin. Resources can spawn on tiles with ruins, but they will not be visible or able to be exploited until the ruin is cleared.

## Strategy[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FRuin%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D2&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

It is recommended that early-game the focus be on expansion and capturing villages instead of examining ruins. However, examine ruins that otherwise may be taken by enemies. 

Because of the variety of possible rewards, it can be risky to go for ruins and rely on them. This is especially true in the early game whether the player should get to a ruin or a village. If the ruin is in a place where there is no way an enemy can grab the ruin, it is recommended to expand and explore the map. However. if the ruin is very close to an enemy, it is recommended to explore the ruin as there are many things an enemy can receive from a ruin, including getting a strong unit very close to the player's territory.

## Trivia[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FRuin%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D4&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

  * If the ruin provides a unit as a reward, the examining unit is pushed in a [forced unit spawn](</wiki/Forced_Unit_Spawns> "Forced Unit Spawns").
  * The [∑∫ỹriȱŋ](<∑∫ỹriȱŋ.md> "∑∫ỹriȱŋ") tribe can see ruins through [clouds](<../game_mechanics/Terrain.md> "Terrain").
  * Before [update 2.0.58](<Update_History.md> "Update History"), ruins on land granted a [Giant](</wiki/Giant> "Giant") instead of a veteran Swordsman on land. A Giant could only be earned as early as turn 5. Also, ruins could not spawn next to villages.
