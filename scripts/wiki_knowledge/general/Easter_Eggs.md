An **Easter egg** is an intentional hidden feature. _The Battle of Polytopia_ currently features five Easter eggs, the most notable of which are the [Bunny](</wiki/Bunny> "Bunny"), the "sunrise" background, and mixed tribes.

## Bunny[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FEaster_Eggs%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D1&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

The [Bunny](</wiki/Bunny> "Bunny") is a [unit](</wiki/Unit> "Unit") spawned by tapping an unoccupied tile in the player's territory ten times. (To prevent abuse, it can only be spawned in single-player.) The Nature Bunny will [destroy](</wiki/Destroy> "Destroy") any building it moves onto. 

During the December holiday season, the Bunny is replaced by the Bunta, which resembles [Santa Claus](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus> "wikipedia:Santa Claus") in appearance but is otherwise identical to the Bunny.

## Luxidoor Easter Egg[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FEaster_Eggs%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D2&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

[![The Luxidoor head](images/The_Luxidoor_head.webp)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/1/14/Luxidoor.png/revision/latest?cb=20160429080522>)

The Luxidoor head

On mobile, players who do not own the [Luxidoor](<../tribes/Luxidoor.md> "Luxidoor") tribe may encounter it as an opponent in single-player games. This is related to the fact that Luxidoor is more expensive than other tribes.[1] On Steam, this Easter egg is extended to any tribe that the player does not own because Luxidoor is included in the base game. 

## Sunrise Background[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FEaster_Eggs%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D3&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

The night sky background can be changed to a yellow-to-pink "sunrise" gradient by holding it then releasing after 20 seconds. This change can be reverted by holding the background for 20 seconds again or by relaunching the game. 

This Easter egg was introduced in [update 1.5](<Update_History.md> "Update History"). 

## Mixed Tribes Easter Egg[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FEaster_Eggs%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D4&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

[![An Instagram post about at the Mixed Tribes Easter egg. It quotes, "Those who reached the highest deed can merge together in harmony](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/a/af/Mixed_tribes_easter_egg_instagram.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200713212313>) [![An Instagram post about at the Mixed Tribes Easter egg. It quotes, "Those who reached the highest deed can merge together in harmony](images/An_Instagram_post_about_at_the_Mixed_Tribes_Easter_egg._It_quotes,__Those_who_reached_the_highest_de.webp)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/a/af/Mixed_tribes_easter_egg_instagram.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200713212313>) [](</wiki/File:Mixed_tribes_easter_egg_instagram.jpg>)

An [Instagram post](<https://www.instagram.com/p/B3b0aZDhJ77/>) about at the Mixed Tribes Easter egg. It quotes, "Those who reached the highest deed can merge together in harmony."

The Mixed Tribes Easter egg allows players to merge two [tribes](</wiki/Tribes> "Tribes") in the tribe selection menu. Only tribes on which the player has three stars can be merged. Hence, tribes can only be merged in the Perfection and Domination [game modes](</wiki/Game_modes> "Game modes"). To merge two tribes: 

  * On mobile, hold the two tribes' icons simultaneously.
  * On Steam, hold down the alt key, click the first tribe's icon, then hold the second tribe's icon. (Do not release the alt key until the merge is completed.)

As two tribes merge, sparks travel between their icons. 

Mixed tribes have some of the aesthetics of the tribe selected first but the gameplay of the tribe selected second. Specifically, the first tribe determines the first four characters of the name, city style, color, and unit style of the mixed tribe; the second tribe determines the last three characters of the name, [terrain](<../game_mechanics/Terrain.md> "Terrain") style, music, skin, and [technology](</wiki/Technology> "Technology") (including starting and special technology, where applicable) of the mixed tribe. 

Using mixed tribes, units that would not usually not be accessible to some special tribes can be found. (Such units can also be obtained without merging tribes by the special tribe [converting](</wiki/Mind_Bender> "Mind Bender") a unit it cannot get.) For example, Cymanti aesthetics with a regular tribe gameplay can end up showing Cymanti naval units. 

High scores for mixed tribes are saved in the Throne Room. 

This Easter egg was introduced in [update 1.14.2](<Update_History.md> "Update History"). 

## ∑∫ỹriȱŋ Language[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FEaster_Eggs%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D5&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

[![The ∑∫ỹriȱŋ head](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/b/b2/Elyrion.png/revision/latest?cb=20201126203127>) [![The ∑∫ỹriȱŋ head](images/The_∑∫ỹriȱŋ_head.webp)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/b/b2/Elyrion.png/revision/latest?cb=20201126203127>)

The ∑∫ỹriȱŋ head

The [∑∫ỹriȱŋ](<∑∫ỹriȱŋ.md> "∑∫ỹriȱŋ") language option (in the settings menu) is an Easter egg available to players that own the ∑∫ỹriȱŋ tribe. The language was written by [Zoythrus](</wiki/User:Zoythrus> "User:Zoythrus"). 

This Easter egg was introduced in [update 1.15.1](<Update_History.md> "Update History"). 

## Floating and Sinking City (Removed)[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FEaster_Eggs%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D6&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

[![A floating city](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/7/76/Floating_City.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200713221029>) [![A floating city](images/A_floating_city.webp)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/7/76/Floating_City.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20200713221029>) [](</wiki/File:Floating_City.jpg>)

A floating city

This Easter egg made a city visually float upwards or sink downwards if the tiles at its bottom-left and bottom-right were tapped alternatingly. Tapping on the bottom-left first caused the city to rise, while tapping on the bottom-right first caused the city to sink. This was a purely cosmetic change that would be reverted when a unit is trained in the city or the turn ends. 

This Easter egg was removed in 2021, likely unintentionally.[2]

But, hey, they have a chance to show up in your games as an enemy even if you don't own them._
  2. ↑ Zoythrus: _From what I'm understanding, they were never officially removed. Like, we never said "We're removing this easter egg." Pretty sure it's a bug that prevents it from happening._
