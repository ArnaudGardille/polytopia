[![Skull](images/Skull.webp)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/4/4a/Skull.png/revision/latest?cb=20231123012136>)This feature has been [removed](</wiki/Category:Removed> "Category:Removed").

**Whale Hunting** was an ability that could only be used on a tile with a whale, removed the whale from the tile, and gives the player 10 [stars](</wiki/Stars> "Stars"). The ability was unlocked by the [Whaling](</wiki/Whaling> "Whaling") [technology](<Technology.md> "Technology"). 

For the [∑∫ỹriȱŋ](<∑∫ỹriȱŋ.md> "∑∫ỹriȱŋ") [tribe](<Tribes.md> "Tribe"), Whale Hunting was replaced by the Enchant ability, which allows ∑∫ỹriȱŋ to enchant a whale into a powerful [Navalon](</wiki/Navalon> "Navalon") [unit](</wiki/Unit> "Unit") at a cost of five stars. 

This ability was replaced by Gather Stars from the new [Starfish](<Starfish_Harvesting.md> "Starfish") in [Path of the Ocean](</wiki/Path_of_the_Ocean_Beta> "Path of the Ocean Beta"), which essentially replaced whales. 

## Trivia[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FWhale_Hunting%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D1&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

  * Originally, there was a cost associated with Whale Hunting. The cost was proportional to the number of [cities](</wiki/Cities> "Cities") a player had, and, eventually, the cost would exceed the 10-star reward. This cost was later removed.
  * Midjiwan, the game developer, condemns hunting actual whales.[1]
