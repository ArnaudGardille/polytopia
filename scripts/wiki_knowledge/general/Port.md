The **Port** is a [building](</wiki/Building> "Building") that costs 7 [stars](</wiki/Stars> "Stars"), produces one [population](<../city/Population.md> "Population"), turns a land [unit](</wiki/Unit> "Unit") that moves onto it into a [Raft](</wiki/Raft> "Raft"), and forms [city connections](</wiki/City_connections> "City connections") over water with [cities](</wiki/Cities> "Cities") or other Ports no more than four water tiles away. The building is unlocked by the [Fishing](</wiki/Fishing> "Fishing") [technology](<Technology.md> "Technology") and can only be built in shallow water or on flooded fields.

  * The [Dagger](</wiki/Dagger> "Dagger") will become a [Pirate](</wiki/Pirate> "Pirate").
  * Units with the float and fly [skills](<Unit_Skills.md> "Unit Skills") do not change.

Players cannot use any Port in enemy territory.
