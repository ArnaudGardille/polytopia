The tribe selection menu

    _This article is about the playable civilizations. For resource spawn rate modifiers, see[Map Generation](<../game_mechanics/Map_Generation.md> "Map Generation")._

**Tribes** are civilizations that players play as. Each tribe has a unique starting [technology](<Technology.md> "Technology") and [resource spawn rates](<../game_mechanics/Map_Generation.md> "Map Generation"). There are sixteen tribes, including twelve regular tribes and four special tribes, which each have their own unique technology tree, units, and buildings. 

Tribes are unlocked via microtransactions. On mobile, four tribes—[Xin-xi](<../tribes/Xin-xi.md> "Xin-xi"), [Imperius](<../tribes/Imperius.md> "Imperius"), [Bardur](<../tribes/Bardur.md> "Bardur"), and [Oumaji](<../tribes/Oumaji.md> "Oumaji")—are available for free; the others are available as in-app purchases that cost from $0.99 to $4.49 USD. On Steam, all regular tribes are included in the base game, and special tribes are available as DLC. Purchases help to pay for game development, maintain servers, and keep the game free of advertisements.[1]

Each tribe has a unique cosmetic design for [terrain](<../game_mechanics/Terrain.md> "Terrain"), [units](<Units.md> "Units"), [cities](<City.md> "Cities"), and [monuments](<Buildings.md> "Monuments"). Each tribe also has its own music and ambience, which plays when its "native" tiles are selected. For instance, a rattlesnake is heard on Oumaji tiles, and howling wind and wolves are heard on Bardur tiles. Every tribe starts the game with one unit in its capital. Most tribes start with a [Warrior](<../units/Warrior.md> "Warrior"). Some tribes start with the unit associated with their starting [technology](<Technology.md> "Technology"). 

More tribes will continue to be added in the future; however, all future tribes will be special tribes.[2]

15 of the tribes have cosmetic skins, which can be purchased through microtransactions. These skins change the tribe's music, units, cities, and sometimes terrain. The Forgotten skin changes the tribe color, however it is currently the only skin to do so.

The Xin-Xi tribe has been disabled, as shown by its greyed-out tribe head.

> Tribe disabled; it cannot be used by you or the AI.
> 
> In-game description

A player can disable a tribe, which prevents the player and their opponents from picking the tribe. This is done in the tribe picker menu; pressing and holding a tribe head disables (or enables) all other tribes. 

Disabling tribes does not decrease the maximum number of opponents allowed; multiple opponents can play as the same tribe (albeit using different colors) when necessary.
