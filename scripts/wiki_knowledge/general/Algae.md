### Tribe

[Cymanti](<../tribes/Cymanti.md> "Cymanti")

### Technology

[Hydrology](</wiki/Hydrology> "Hydrology")

### Cost

5 stars

### Effect

Allows both land and naval units to travel on it and connects cities, produces one population

**Algae** is a [building](</wiki/Building> "Building") and [terrain](<../game_mechanics/Terrain.md> "Terrain") type exclusive to the [Cymanti](<../tribes/Cymanti.md> "Cymanti") tribe. It is built over water and ocean tiles and allows both land and naval units to travel over it. Additionally, it [connects cities](</wiki/City_Connections> "City Connections") and produces one [population](<../city/Population.md> "Population"). It costs five [stars](</wiki/Stars> "Stars") to build and is also created when a poisoned unit dies or a [Raychi](</wiki/Raychi> "Raychi") explodes over water. 

Algae stops the [movement](<../game_mechanics/Movement.md> "Movement") of units without the creep or fly [unit skills](</wiki/Unit_skills> "Unit skills"), like forests and mountains do, even if the Algae is frozen. 

The [Clathrus](</wiki/Clathrus> "Clathrus") produces one star per turn for each adjacent Algae. 

Land units placed on algae will still receive the defense bonus provided by the [Aquatism](<Aquatism.md> "Aquatism") technology, assuming it has been researched.
