It is written in [Unity](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_\(game_engine\)> "wikipedia:Unity \(game engine\)").

Also, the [Sanctuary](</wiki/Sanctuary> "Sanctuary") no longer counted animals that live in forests with a [Lumber Hut](</wiki/Lumber_Hut> "Lumber Hut"). 

Version 2.0.38, released on January 26, 2021, allowed tribe encounters to be triggered by revealing an enemy city, even if the city has no enemy unit in it. 

[![Cymanti Release](images/Cymanti_Release.webp)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/8/8f/Cymanti_Release.png/revision/latest?cb=20210217163145>) [](</wiki/File:Cymanti_Release.png>)

In this update, whales were restricted from spawning adjacent to a city or another whale, the [Clear Forest](</wiki/Clear_Forest> "Clear Forest") ability was moved from the [Forestry](</wiki/Forestry> "Forestry") technology to [Free Spirit](</wiki/Free_Spirit> "Free Spirit"), the income from Clear Forest was reduced from two stars to one, and [Luxidoor](</wiki/Luxidoor> "Luxidoor")'s capital was reduced from a level 3 city with a [city wall](</wiki/City_wall> "City wall") to a level 2 city.[2]

Version 2.0.53, released on June 9, 2021, introduced the ["Battle Preview" feature](</wiki/Battle_Preview> "Battle Preview"), allowed capturing a level 5+ city to finish the [Metropolis](</wiki/Metropolis> "Metropolis") task, and made players more likely to spawn further apart from each other.[3]

Version 2.0.58, released on September 8, 2021, was named "Balance Pass 2." This update restored the income from [Clear Forest](</wiki/Clear_Forest> "Clear Forest") to two stars, increased the price of the [Knight](</wiki/Knight> "Knight") to 10 stars, lowered the cost of the [Burn Forest](</wiki/Burn_Forest> "Burn Forest") ability to two stars, removed [∑∫ỹriȱŋ](</wiki/%E2%88%91%E2%88%AB%E1%BB%B9ri%C8%B1%C5%8B> "∑∫ỹriȱŋ")'s access to Burn Forest, changed the land unit ruin reward from a super unit to a veteran [Swordsman](</wiki/Swordsman> "Swordsman"), allowed ruins to spawn next to villages, made ruins more likely to spawn on mountains, standarized the tribe encounter reward to a star reward based on the encountered tribe's score, moved the mountain defence bonus from the [Meditation](</wiki/Meditation> "Meditation") technology [Climbing](</wiki/Climbing> "Climbing"), introduced an in-game [Elo multiplayer rating system](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system> "wikipedia:Elo rating system"), and modified the [Oumaji](</wiki/Oumaji> "Oumaji") headscarf to be more realistic. This update also included balance changes for the [Cymanti](</wiki/Cymanti> "Cymanti") tribe: the defence reduction due to [poison](</wiki/Poison> "Poison") was increased from 20% to 30%, poison can now be removed by healing once instead of healing to maximum health, the movement penalty imposed by [Fungi](</wiki/Fungi> "Fungi") was removed, any [boost](</wiki/Boost> "Boost") effect is now removed by defending against an attack or exploring a ruin, a [Segment](</wiki/Segment> "Segment") can now be converted to convert the entire [Centipede](</wiki/Centipede> "Centipede"), the [Phychi](</wiki/Phychi> "Phychi") gained the _[surprise](</wiki/Unit_Skills#surprise> "Unit Skills")_ unit skill, the [Raychi](</wiki/Raychi> "Raychi")'s price was increased from five to eight stars, the [Hexapod](</wiki/Hexapod> "Hexapod")'s price was increased from two to three stars, the [Algae](</wiki/Algae> "Algae")'s population was removed, and the Algae now connects cities. 

Version 2.2, released on May 24, 2022, introduced the [Diplomacy](</wiki/Diplomacy> "Diplomacy") technology and its associated mechanics, including the [Cloak](</wiki/Cloak> "Cloak") and [Dagger](</wiki/Dagger> "Dagger") units and the [Embassy](</wiki/Embassy> "Embassy") building. Accordingly, the Shields technology was renamed to [Strategy](</wiki/Strategy> "Strategy"), as it now unlocks the [Peace Treaty](</wiki/Peace_Treaty> "Peace Treaty").

Version 2.2.9, released on Oct 10, 2022, adjusted Cloaks by allowing all units to detect them and giving them the Scout and Creep abilities. Infiltration's design was improved and causes damage to defending units. Cities can only be infiltrated once per turn, and an infiltrated city's income is stolen by its attacker. Additionally, Daggers now have a naval form, the Pirate. To balance special tribes, Crabs' movement was increased, along with decreases in explosion and fungi damage. Ice Banks and intertribal healing have been tweaked. 

Version 2.8 was the [Path of the Ocean](</wiki/Path_of_the_Ocean> "Path of the Ocean") update which released on November 21, 2023. This version completely reworked the polytopia naval system. All old naval units were removed and replaced with Rafts, Scouts, Rammers, Bombers, and Juggernauts. We saw new resources with Aqua Farms and Starfish, and new buildings with bridges and markets. The naval tech tree was reshuffled a bit with the most notable change being that ports were now available on a tier 1 tech. Specials got some minor adjustments to make them work with the new naval system. This patch also saw the addition of the new Pangea map type and lighthouses were added to all maps. Finally, this patch also nerfed roads, lumberhuts, and swordsmen. 

Version 2.8.5 was designated "Patch of the Ocean" and was released on February 26, 2024[4]. This patch saw the removal of Aqua Farms, a rework of the markets, some more shuffling of the tech tree, changes to bridges, a bomber nerf, a starfish nerf, and some more tweaks. 

Version 2.10.0 reworked the Aquarion tribe. The update replaced all of their land units with amphibious [mermaid counterparts](</wiki/Mermaid_Units> "Mermaid Units"), their land with flooded tiles that incur movement penalties onto naval units, the Scout with a melee [Shark](</wiki/Shark> "Shark"), the Bomber with an area-damaging [Jelly](</wiki/Jelly> "Jelly"), the Catapult with a ranged naval [Puffer](</wiki/Puffer> "Puffer"), Roads with [Atoll](</wiki/Atoll> "Atoll")s that connect to cities within 3 tiles, and Burn Forest with the ability to fertilize fields. It also allowed Aquarion to access Aqua Farms, Lost Cities from Ruins, and the ability to build land improvements on water. [Tridention](</wiki/Tridention> "Tridention")s received the _persist_ skill in place of _escape_ , lost the _fortify_ skill, and had their attack reduced to 2.5. [Crab](</wiki/Crab> "Crab")s received the _auto flood_ ability and a visual improvement. All other tribes gained the ability to manually disembark naval units on bridges and flooded tiles as well as the "Landfill" ability to counteract flooding. The _float_ skill was also split into _water_ and _amphibious_ to better explain its function.
