### Unlocked by

[Free Spirit](</wiki/Free_Spirit> "Free Spirit")

### Effect

Removes a unit and returns half of its cost (rounded down)

**Disband** is a [unit ability](</wiki/Unit_Abilities> "Unit Abilities") that removes a [unit](</wiki/Unit> "Unit") and returns half of its cost (rounded down to the nearest [star](<Star.md> "Star")). Disbanding a unit deducts its point value from the player's [score](<../game_mechanics/Score.md> "Score"). Like other unit abilities, Disband can only be used by units that have not performed any action, like moving, during the turn. Disband is unlocked by the [Free Spirit](</wiki/Free_Spirit> "Free Spirit") [technology](<Technology.md> "Technology"). 

Disbanding a [super unit](</wiki/Super_unit> "Super unit") returns five stars. (Super units have a theoretical cost of 10 stars.) Disbanding a [Ship](</wiki/Ship> "Ship") or [Battleship](</wiki/Battleship> "Battleship") only returns half the cost of the unit it carries. No portion of the cost of the upgrade from a [Boat](</wiki/Boat> "Boat") is returned. 

The icon for Disband is three stars arranged in a triangle.
