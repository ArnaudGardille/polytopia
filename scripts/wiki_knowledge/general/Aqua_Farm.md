The **Aqua Farm** is a [building](</wiki/Building> "Building") unique to the [Aquarion](<../tribes/Aquarion.md> "Aquarion") tribe that costs five [stars](</wiki/Stars> "Stars") and produces two [population](<../city/Population.md> "Population"). The building is unlocked by the [Aquaculture](</wiki/Aquaculture> "Aquaculture") technology and can only be built on ocean tiles with crop (visible once [Organization](<../technology/Organization.md> "Organization") has been researched). [Windmills](</wiki/Windmill> "Windmill") produce one population if placed next to an Aqua Farm. 

The Aqua Farm was originally added in the [Path of the Ocean](</wiki/Path_of_the_Ocean> "Path of the Ocean") update and available to all tribes; it was shortly after removed in the Patch of the Ocean update before being reintroduced as a building unique to Aquarion.
