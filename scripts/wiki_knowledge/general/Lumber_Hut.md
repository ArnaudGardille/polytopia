### Technology

[Forestry](</wiki/Forestry> "Forestry")

### Cost

3 stars

### Effect

Produces one population

The **Lumber Hut** is a [building](</wiki/Building> "Building") built on forest tiles that costs three [stars](</wiki/Stars> "Stars") and produces one [population](<../city/Population.md> "Population"). It is unlocked by [Forestry](</wiki/Forestry> "Forestry"). 

The [Sawmill](</wiki/Sawmill> "Sawmill") produces one population per adjacent Lumber Hut. 

#### Strategy[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FLumber_Hut%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D1&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

Lumber huts are relatively easy to build, but they produce less population per star than [hunting](</wiki/Hunting> "Hunting"), [fishing](</wiki/Fishing> "Fishing"), [harvesting fruit](<../technology/Organization.md> "Organization"), forges, and farms. For only 3 stars they give you one population, which allows you to grow cities in the mid-game, especially when playing as tribes with high forest spawn rates. Lumber huts are essential for forest-heavy tribes like [Bardur](<../tribes/Bardur.md> "Bardur"), and are all-around a decent building. When combined with [spiritualism](</wiki/Spiritualism> "Spiritualism") and [mathematics](</wiki/Mathematics> "Mathematics"), as well as a good economy, you can grow forests, add lumber huts, slap down [sawmills](</wiki/Sawmill> "Sawmill"), and crank out [giants](</wiki/Giant> "Giant") or [parks](</wiki/Park> "Park"). Although they aren't as efficient as [windmill](</wiki/Windmill> "Windmill") \+ [farms](<Farm.md> "Farm"), they are a cheaper, more achievable way to get large amounts of [population](<../city/Population.md> "Population").
