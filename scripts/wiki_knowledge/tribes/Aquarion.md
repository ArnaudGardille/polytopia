> Tribe description

**Aquarion** is the first special [tribe](<../general/Tribes.md> "Tribe") and the 11th tribe overall in Polytopia. Aquarion starts with no visible starting [technology](</wiki/Technology> "Technology") but a hidden tech that allows them to build structures on water/ocean tiles and a [Mermaid](</wiki/Mermaid> "Mermaid") [unit](</wiki/Units> "Units"); their other special units include the [Tridention](</wiki/Tridention> "Tridention"), the [Shark](</wiki/Shark> "Shark"), the [Puffer](</wiki/Puffer> "Puffer"), the [Jelly](</wiki/Jelly> "Jelly") and the [Crab](</wiki/Crab> "Crab"). 

In addition to its amphibious units, all of Aquarion's units are able to move on water tiles. Befittingly, this makes them a very powerful naval tribe.

The old Spearing branch of the Aquarion technology tree

The Aquarion tribe's special features are deeply tied to their aquatic nature. They are a unique tribe, distinguished by their ability to place all their buildings on water/ocean tiles and have all of their land-based units function as amphibious units, which grants them the powerful advantage of being able to move seamlessly from land to water without requiring a boat. This characteristic allows for aggressive coastal assaults and fast exploration across water heavy maps. Furthermore, the Aquarion have special terrain, which is often composed of flooded tiles that allow greater mobility for their amphibious units while acting as rough terrain for all naval units They also have access to special structures like the Atoll which connects cities over water, and the ability to find and claim Lost Cities from the deep ocean ruins, providing unique avenues for early expansion and economic development centered around the water. These traits combine to make a playstyle that focuses on early naval dominance.

[![](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/5/5d/GrowForest.png/revision/latest?cb=20200603224245>)This page is currently **under construction**. It may be incomplete or inaccurate. Please help Polytopia Wiki by [editing it](<https://polytopia.fandom.com/wiki/Aquarion?action=edit>).

All of Aquarion's land based units are amphibious These units are able to move on both land and water, however their movement is slowed if they move on land that is not flooded. They otherwise function the same as their regular counterparts. 

For a full list of Aquarion's units, see _[List of Units](<https://polytopia.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Units#Aquarion>)_. 

[![Flooded tile](data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/f/f7/Flood.png/revision/latest?cb=20240816114248>) [![Flooded tile](images/Flooded_tile.webp)](<https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/supertribes/images/f/f7/Flood.png/revision/latest?cb=20240816114248>) [](</wiki/File:Flood.png>)

A flooded field tile

### Flooded Terrain[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FAquarion%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D3&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

Unique to Aquarion, flooded terrain is a type of terrain that both land and water units can move through, although water units are slowed by it. Flooded terrain generates naturally within Aquarion's environment, but the tribe can also spread it to dry tiles using [Puffers](</wiki/Puffer> "Puffer"), [Crabs](</wiki/Crab> "Crab"), and the Flood unit skill that is unlocked from the Waterways technology. Fields and forests can be flooded, but mountains cannot. 

Units on flooded tiles gain the _drain_ unit ability, which when used causes the tile to revert back to its original, non-flooded form. This can even be done by ships and can be used by enemies to impede Aquarion's movement. Additionally, ships that are placed on flooded tiles gain the _disembark_ unit ability, which causes them to turn back into the unit they are carrying as if they moved onto land tiles. 

Anything that can normally be built on land tiles can still be built on flooded tiles, with the addition of [ports](</wiki/Port> "Port"). 

### Lost Cities[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FAquarion%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D4&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

Lost Cities are a feature unique to the Aquarion tribe, representing old cities they can restore for a massive economic advantage. They are found by examining Ocean Ruins—unlike other tribes who receive a technology, stars, or a unit—the Aquarion will instead find a Lost City, provided the ruin tile is a valid spot for a new city. Upon discovery, a Lost City emerges as a Level 1 city, and it adds some resources surrounding water/ocean tiles to aid in city growth. This mechanic allows the Aquarion to establish settlements in the middle of the sea, mainly acting as compensation for their limited land mobility 

Aquarion has 0.5x forest. There are guaranteed to be two water tiles with fish in the capital even on drylands map type

Eons ago the Aquarion sunk beneath the waves to watch the other tribes from a close but safe distance. They adapted and grew gills and fins "as seen on their heads" and grew mermaid tails to move freely in the water while also being compatible on land. Their tribe previously lived in harmony with Turmelons and crabs. However, Aquarion was disturbed by and now participates in the "Square-wide struggle."[1][2]

The Aquarion have been described as a "lawful good" tribe, who view themselves as peacekeepers of the Square, even if bringing peace requires conquering everyone else first. [3] It is implied that the tribe once had a network of outposts around the Square, which were pulled back for some unspecified reason. [4] It was the pulling back of these outposts which resulted in the creation of the Forgotten, who, for whatever reason, became cut off from their homeland, and evolved into Squid-like Marsh dwellers. [5]

  * When the Turmelons are not helping Aquarion warriors, they like to spend their time in the mysterious depths of the ocean, swimming about in the palace of the lost city.[6]
  * Aquarion warriors always... drink a mixture of salt water and octopus blood before going to battle.[7]

The splash screen for the Forgotten skin in the Tribe Selection menu.

The Forgotten skin is the second special tribe skin. It is based around swamps, marshes, and cephalopods. They have green skin with blue scales, three green crests, shiny black eyes, and spiky gills protruding from their heads. They are the only tribe skin to change the tribe color, with the Aquarion coral pink being replaced by a muted swamp green  (#678c30). 

  * The fields have variegated grass similar to those of Cymanti.
  * The fruits are replaced with pink water lilies known as Bog Lillums.
  * The forests are near-identical to the Aquarion seaweed, albeit with darker green colors.
  * The Turmelon are replaced with green crocodiles known as Croca.

The mountain used in earlier iterations of Aquarion

  * During part of its beta testing period, Aquarion started with the [Aquatism](</wiki/Aquatism> "Aquatism") technology.
  * An early version of Aquarion also had different mountains, fruits, forests, city buildings and syllables, and access to [Giant](</wiki/Giant> "Giant")s instead of Crabs.
  * In the Adobe AIR version, there existed an unused Aquarion field tile with a sandy base.
  * Aquarion's resources were adjusted in [update 2.0.58](</wiki/Update_History> "Update History").
