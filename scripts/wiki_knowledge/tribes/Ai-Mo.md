> 
> Tribe description

**Ai-Mo** is the tenth [tribe](<../general/Tribes.md> "Tribe") in Polytopia. Ai-Mo is a regular tribe. It starts with the [Meditation](</wiki/Meditation> "Meditation") [technology](</wiki/Technology> "Technology"). 

Ai-Mo is a lower-mid-tier tribe. It has varied resources, and Meditation is a sub-par starting technology, being neither a resource nor a military technology. Also, its benefits have little use, especially in the early game, besides the fact that it allows Ai-Mo to receive an [Altar of Peace](</wiki/Altar_of_Peace> "Altar of Peace") as early as turn 5. Furthermore, the technology Meditation leads to, [Philosophy](</wiki/Philosophy> "Philosophy"), is rarely used and has the greatest utility during the late-game. These factors make Ai-Mo particularly weak in the early and mid-game as it needs to research various resource and military technologies.

  * These isolationist tribes people are more interested in meditating and living in harmony instead of fighting, but are more than willing to pick up their swords when the need arises![1]

The Instagram post introducing the Ai-Mo tribe

We, the tranquil Ai-Mo tribe, are _this_ close to reaching Enlightenment and Eternal Peace. _This close._ There is just one slight problem – all the other tribes. If they could just avoid living on the Square, disturbing our tranquil meditation it would be perfect. If they could just follow our example – drink llama milk, have a mind-melting wild chili from time to time, and focusing on finding inner peace – we would all live in harmony together... If you don’t like it, you rest in pieces. And please: Ssshhhh!!![2]

2023 Tribe Moon: Ai-Mo society is isolationist and tends to prefer keeping to itself, preferring minimal contact with the other tribes if they can help it. Regular Ai-Moyan border patrols keep the land safe from invaders, like this band of Bardur raiders, who didn't stand a chance!

The 2025 Ai-Mo Tribe Moon poster

2025 Tribe Moon: The Ai-Mo may believe that peace is gained through stillness, but the To-Lï meditate through movement - their bodies are their temples and fitness is their worship. This sub-group of Ai-Mo are considered borderline heretical by more orthodox Ai-Mo, but no one can argue with their mighty strength.

### Webshop[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FAi-Mo%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D5&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

  * Should you ever get the chance to taste Om-soi, don't hesitate. It holds the power of healing and gives serenity to any anxious mind. Only the Ai-Mo know the recipe, and it has been a well kept secret since the beginning of turns.[4]
  * This traditional costume is usually worn during the Feast of Ai-ioo, a celebration dedicated to the hard-working Llamo. The day is spent with ceremonies and dances to honor and praise the Llamo's great importance to the Ai-Mo people.[5]

The Ai-Mo are influenced by Nepalese, Tibetan and Andean cultures.[6] Prayer Flags, shaved heads, and meditation are icons of Nepalese culture; chili, whitewashed villages, and colorful decorative flags are of the Andes. The Llamos that the Ai-Mo hunts and rides are inspired by real-life llamas, which originate from the mountainous Andes.
