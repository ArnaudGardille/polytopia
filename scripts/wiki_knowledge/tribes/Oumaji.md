> The seemingly endless, sun-blessed desert is the home of the Oumaji tribe.
> 
> Tribe description

**Oumaji** is the fourth [tribe](<../general/Tribes.md> "Tribe") in Polytopia. It is a free regular tribe, and it starts with the [Riding](</wiki/Riding> "Riding") [technology](</wiki/Technology> "Technology") and a [Rider](</wiki/Rider> "Rider"). 

Oumaji is typically considered to be a lower-mid-tier tribe comparable to [Ai-Mo](</wiki/Ai-Mo> "Ai-Mo") and [Quetzali](</wiki/Quetzali> "Quetzali") due to its relatively slow initial economic development. Its starting technology, [Riding](</wiki/Riding> "Riding"), is not an economy technology, nor does it lead to one. While starting with Riding allows it to quickly explore and capture many villages, Oumaji often cannot easily upgrade its newly-captured cities. This is exacerbated by the fact that utilizing crops, which constitute a large portion of Oumaji's resources, requires the tier two technology [Farming](</wiki/Farming> "Farming"), which may take some time to research. Low-level cities raise technology costs while not providing much income. Therefore, Oumaji is usually outmatched by tribes that start with an economy technology, such as [Bardur](<Bardur.md> "Bardur"), as those tribes can more quickly upgrade cities and have a greater income in the early-game.

The 2020 and 2021 (first blurb) Oumaji Tribe Moon poster

2020 Tribe Moon: The Mausoleum at Ojibake is the final resting place of Mubehasi the Undefeated, the legendary leader of the Oumaji hordes and unifier of the Seven Oumaji Clans. The tower holds the records of their mighty reign and ensures that the memory of Mubehasi lives on in the hearts of all Oumaji!
  * 2021 Tribe Moon: The Oumaji refer to any large grouping of people as a "hamu", which can also be applied to anywhere people congregate. Town Hall? "Hamu". Battlefield? "Hamu". The entire Square? That's right, "Hamu". It was the Battle of the Limdor Dunes that decided the proper number of people for a hamu - at least 5.

2021 Tribe Moon (second blurb): The lands of the Oumaji are home to the Onjimu Riders, an order of Shebron-back town criers who inform the townsfolk of the news through poetry! Now a crucial part of Oumaji culture, poetic delivery of the news has become a competitive sport, with rules, competitions, and even creative regional styles!

The 2022 Oumaji Tribe Moon poster

2022 Tribe Moon: Other tribes may have been blessed with fertile land, abundant resources, or a warrior culture, but the Oumaji have something the others do not - speed. The legendary Shebron can quickly dash over dunes, hills, and plains, and are why the Oumaji excel at hit-and-run raids.

The 2023 Oumaji Tribe Moon video

2023 Tribe Moon: A lifetime of wandering the desert awaits the Oumaji. What are they searching for? What do they hope to find? How will they know when they find it? Maybe the desert has a deeper meaning beyond what the average Oumaji can see, and maybe they can find the meaning in their dreams...

The 2024 Oumaji Tribe Moon poster

2024 Tribe Moon: An oasis in the Suui Desert is a rare find, and herds of Shebron often congregate around these watering holes looking for a drink. The annual "Sia Lu" ceremony needs an ample selection of healthy mounts to choose from, so the Oumaji send scouts to these oases hoping to find Shebrons fit to ride.

The 2025 Oumaji Tribe Moon poster

2025 Tribe Moon: Ages ago, Mubehasi the Undefeated led the Oumaji into a golden age of conquest and splendor, but also caste systems and branded servants. The Khondor Honor Guards still dream of that glorious empire’s return, although most Oumaji have no desire to trade freedom for marble and memory.

  * The best way to savor a cup of Oulu is at a temperature of 187°F. It is made of "things" the Oumaji find in the desert, unclear what exactly, but it tastes a bit like hot air. The Oumaji usually enjoy it among friends after a late dinner prepared over an open fire.[1]
  * To survive a trip through the vast Oumaji desert you would most definitely need a trusted companion. A beautiful striped Shebra can carry you many tiles without complaining, and provide a nice shade to rest in while having a snack along the way.[2]
  * Most people don't know that the Shebrons are vain animals. If you need to find an oasis in the desert, the Shebron will be your best companion since it's always looking for a lake so it can admire itself in its reflection. If your Shebron seems low for any reason, you can use a fake mirror to cheer it up.[3]
  * The Cacti is the most difficult plant to harvest if one is not equipped with this special Cacti blade. In fact, the poisonous thorns will most likely kill anyone who tries. With the Cacti blade, you have a chance to get hold of the special Cacti pulp, said to heal wounds and the disease of the yellow mountains.[4]

## Inspiration[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FOumaji%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D5&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

Oumaji is based on North Africa.[5] Adobe buildings and headscarves were common in these cultures, and the Oumaji biome resembles the open deserts which are characteristic of much of North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Their palm oasis forests are also important geographical features in these regions. Moreover, their Eye of God somewhat resembles the waterfalls of Wadi El Rayan. The Khondor skin is distinctly Egyptian, invoking images of the Sphinx, and cats which were revered in Egyptian culture. 

Their lore also contains hints of Middle-Eastern influence. For example, the unification of the Seven Oumaji Clans is reminiscent of the Biblical Twelve Tribes of Israel. Furthermore, the Oumaji word "hamu", which does not distinguish anything over the size of 5, is echoed in the languages of Ancient Mesopotamia, where the Akkadian word "_ālu"_ meant any place where a group of people lived together, regardless of its size or population.

### Trivia[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FOumaji%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D16&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

  * In one early iteration of the the Khondor skin, they were called "Khehimu", and their description read, "This ancient order of Honor Guards has been around since the time of the warring Oumaji clans. Their Sphelix mounts strike both fear and awe in the hearts of all who oppose them!"
  * The Khondor skin is referred to as "Sfinx" in game files. This is likely a misspelling of "sphinx", a mythical creature whose Egyptian origin may have influenced the Khondor and whose name inspired that of Khondor's animal.

The original version of the Oumaji head

  * Before [Zebasi](</wiki/Zebasi> "Zebasi") was released, Oumaji had the acacia trees that Zebasi now has.
  * The Oumaji headscarf was changed in [version 2.0.58](</wiki/Version_History> "Version History") because the original version appeared 'poorly wrapped'.[8]
