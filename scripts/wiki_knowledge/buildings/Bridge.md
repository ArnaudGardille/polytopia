### Technology

Roads

### Cost

5 stars

### Effect

Connects cities and gives a movement bonus to units moving along connected roads. Allow land units to traverse one tile of water

The **Bridge** is a building that costs 5 [stars](<../general/Star.md> "Star") and functions as a water equivalent to [roads](</wiki/Roads_\(Building\)> "Roads \(Building\)"). In addition to halving [movement](<../game_mechanics/Movement.md> "Movement") costs and forming [city connections](</wiki/City_Connections> "City Connections"), they also allow land units to move across one tile of [water](<../game_mechanics/Terrain.md> "Terrain"). Unlike roads, they can be destroyed after being built. It is unlocked by researching the [Roads](</wiki/Roads_\(Technology\)> "Roads \(Technology\)") technology. 

In order to build a bridge, there must be two land tiles in between the water tile where it is built. A bridge can still be built if the land tile on the other side of the bridge is obscured by fog. This has to be horizontal or vertical (diagonal bridges cannot be built). Like roads, they can be built on unoccupied land. 

Naval units can move past bridges. 

Land units placed on bridges will still receive the defense bonus from [Aquatism](</wiki/Aquatism> "Aquatism"), if it has been researched. 

[Algae](</wiki/Algae> "Algae") is a [Cymanti](<../tribes/Cymanti.md> "Cymanti") building that functions similarly to bridges. 

The Bridge was added during the [Path of the Ocean](</wiki/Path_of_the_Ocean> "Path of the Ocean") update. In the [Patch of the Ocean](</wiki/Patch_of_the_Ocean> "Patch of the Ocean") update, its cost was decreased from 7 to 5, and it was made possible to build Bridges that connect to land obscured by fog.
