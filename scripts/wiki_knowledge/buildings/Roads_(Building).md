The two cities on the left and the right are connected to the capital in the center by roads.

**Roads** are [buildings](</wiki/Building> "Building") that cost three [stars](</wiki/Stars> "Stars"), halve [movement](<../game_mechanics/Movement.md> "Movement") cost of tiles they are built on, and form [city connections](</wiki/City_Connections> "City Connections"). Other buildings can be built on top of roads. Roads are unlocked with the [technology](<../general/Technology.md> "Technology") [of the same name](</wiki/Roads_\(Technology\)> "Roads \(Technology\)"). 

Roads can be built on any [terrain](<../game_mechanics/Terrain.md> "Terrain") type except mountains, water, ice, and [Algae](</wiki/Algae> "Algae"). Roads can be built underneath neutral villages but these roads will disappear if the village is captured. Players cannot build or benefit from roads in enemy territory, but any player can build and benefit from roads in neutral territory. Roads cannot be [destroyed](<../general/Destroy.md> "Destroy"). The [Port](</wiki/Port> "Port") can be used to extend trade connections over water. If a player has a [peace treaty](</wiki/Strategy> "Strategy") with another tribe, they both can gain movement bonuses from each others' roads. 

For more information on how roads impact movement, see [Movement#Roads](<../game_mechanics/Movement.md> "Movement"). 

The [Cymanti](<../tribes/Cymanti.md> "Cymanti") [tribe](<../general/Tribes.md> "Tribe") has the [Mycelium](</wiki/Mycelium> "Mycelium") instead of roads. 

Prior to the [Path of The Ocean](</wiki/Path_of_the_Ocean> "Path of the Ocean") update, roads cost two stars instead of three.
