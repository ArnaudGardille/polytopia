**Score** is a measure of how much a player has achieved in Polytopia. Points are earned in four categories: [Army](</wiki/Units> "Units") and Territory, [Cities](</wiki/Cities> "Cities"), [Monuments](</wiki/Monuments> "Monuments") and [Temples](</wiki/Temples> "Temples"), and [Science](</wiki/Science> "Science"). Points are lost when a city is captured by an enemy, a [building](</wiki/Building> "Building") is [destroyed](</wiki/Destroy> "Destroy"), or a unit is killed or [disbanded](</wiki/Disband> "Disband").   
  
The following is a breakdown of how score is calculated. 

Army and Territory: 

  * Units: 5 points per star of a unit's cost. [Super units](</wiki/Super_Unit> "Super Unit") are worth 50 points each. (They have a theoretical cost of 10 stars.) Ship and battleship upgrades do not give extra score. Converted units do not change score for either player.
  * Territory: 20 points per tile in the player's territory.
  * Exploration: 5 points per explored tile.

Cities: 

  * Cities: 100 points plus 50 points per level above level 1. 
    * Each [population](</wiki/Population> "Population") gained is worth five points, and upgrading to level 2 gives a 40 point bonus, upgrading to level 3 gives a 35 point bonus, etc. for a total of 50 points per level above level 1. Upgrading to a level of 10 and above will give negative points (not counting park or super unit points).
  * [Park](</wiki/Park> "Park"): 250 points each.
  * level 1 city + 9 tiles territory = 280 points

Monuments and Temples: 

  * Monuments: 400 points each.
  * Temples: 100 points plus 50 points per level above level 1.

Science: 

  * Technology: 100 points per tier of the technology.

## Starting Scores by Tribe[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FScore%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D1&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

These scores can be used to guess which tribe opponent players are using. 

Score | Tribe(s)   
---|---  
415  | [Aquarion](<../tribes/Aquarion.md> "Aquarion")  
515 | [Xin](<../tribes/Xin-xi.md> "Xin-xi")-xi, [Imperius](<../tribes/Imperius.md> "Imperius"), [Bardur](<../tribes/Bardur.md> "Bardur"), [Elyrion,](<../general/∑∫ỹriȱŋ.md> "∑∫ỹriȱŋ") [Kickoo](<../tribes/Kickoo.md> "Kickoo"), [Luxidoor](<../tribes/Luxidoor.md> "Luxidoor")  
520 | [Oumaji](<../tribes/Oumaji.md> "Oumaji")  
530 | [Polaris](<../tribes/Polaris.md> "Polaris")  
565 | Bardur, Imperius, Kickoo (with upgraded capital)   
615 | [Zebasi](<../tribes/Zebasi.md> "Zebasi"), [Yadakk](</wiki/Yadakk> "Yadakk")  
620 | [Quetzali](<../tribes/Quetzali.md> "Quetzali"), [Hoodrick](<../tribes/Hoodrick.md> "Hoodrick")  
630 | [Cymanti](<../tribes/Cymanti.md> "Cymanti")  
650 | Yadakk (with roads diagonal expansion and new warrior)   
665 | Zebasi (with upgraded capital)   
730 | [Vengir](<../tribes/Vengir.md> "Vengir"), [Ai-Mo](<../tribes/Ai-Mo.md> "Ai-Mo")  
  
NOTE: If someone spawns in a corner, due to the update where lighthouses have to be revealed by exploration, that corner tile will be obscured by the clouds. This will result in 5 points less than usual. For example, if someone has a starting score of 510 points, they have spawned in a corner and are playing any of the 515 point tribes. 

## Perfection Difficulty Bonus[[](<https://auth.fandom.com/signin?redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fpolytopia.fandom.com%2Fwiki%2FScore%3Fveaction%3Dedit%26section%3D2&uselang=en> "Sign in to edit")]

A difficulty bonus is applied to the final score in the Perfection game mode. This bonus is equal to 100% plus 41% of the natural logarithm of the number of opponents, with an additional 20%, 40%, or 80% when the difficulty level is normal, hard, or crazy, respectively. The maximum difficulty bonus, with 15 crazy-level opponents, is 291%.
